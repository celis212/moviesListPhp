                One inconvenience I have had in the time I have had in the company has been <strong>the QA qualification</strong>,
                this depends on the quality of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabajo">work</a> and this depends on 
                two things 
            </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>one the <em>detail</em> you have at the time of performing an indexing </li> 
                    <li>the rules we follow according to the <em>page</em> we are watching</li>
                    <li>the time of runnig</li>
                </ul>
            
                ie, its category, amount of work, target audience, among others. this includes something very delicate which is <pre>the empname or name of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company">company</a>, these decisions are taken with respect to some parameters that we saw in the </pre>
                but at the time of the truth is not very detailed and not knowing all these details you can get the lowest score.
                <span>
                    With this in mind I got several bad grades and so I decided to talk to my superior to comment and tell him that 
                </span>
                there was an opportunity for improvement that is in the development of a 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual">
                    manual
                </a> 
                <p>to make the best decision regarding this issue, for this we worked in collaboration with the QA agents, TL, TM and indexers.</p>
